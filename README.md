# 🤖 pistoBot

> Create an AI that (tries) to chat like you.

# 🥜 In a nutshell
1. Get your whatsapp and telegram data
2. Parse it using [this](https://github.com/GuardatiSimone/messaging-chat-parser)
3. Train one of the [available](https://github.com/GuardatiSimone/pistoBot/tree/master/pistoBot) models (gpt2 suggested)
4. Chat with the model

## 👀 Example of chat

An example of GPT-2 model trained on my whatsapp and telegram messages.

**Chat:**<br>
> :pencil2: come sei messo col pistobot?<br>
> :robot: ahaha male<br>
> :pencil2: chatta meglio di te? 😂 <br>
> :robot: si <br>
> :pencil2: non che ci volesse molto... <br>
> :robot: ma tu che dici <br>
> :pencil2: io dico che potevi impegnarti di più <br>

:pencil2: ⟶ message that I have wrote<br>
:robot: ⟶ message generated from the model<br>

# :warning: Disclaimer
This project is only a **personal playground** build during the week-ends of Covid-19 quarantine.<br>
Used mainly to:
- Use interesting packages (like [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple), tensorflow 2.0 etc.)
- Gain experience

Due to this nature, this repository has probably: 
- ML _naif approaches_ 
- For sure: not so good english text (sorry 😢)
